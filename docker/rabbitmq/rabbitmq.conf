# RabbitMQ Configuration for better reliability

# Increase heartbeat timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
# This gives more time for PHP processes to respond
# Note: The heartbeat interval is negotiated between client and server
# The actual interval is the minimum of the client and server values
# heartbeat = 300

# Enable connection recovery
# connection_recovery = true

# Set consumer timeout to 30 minutes (default is 30 minutes)
# This prevents RabbitMQ from closing idle consumers
# consumer_timeout = 1800000

# Log level for debugging (uncomment if needed)
# log.console.level = debug
